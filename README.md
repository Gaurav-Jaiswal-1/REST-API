# REST API Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **RESTful API** designed to provide a structured and scalable solution for handling client-server interactions. The API follows REST principles, enabling efficient communication between clients and servers using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The API is designed with a focus on performance, security, and modularity, supporting easy integration with front-end applications and other services.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **RESTful Architecture**: Follows standard RESTful principles to ensure easy integration and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Includes support for secure authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth) to protect API endpoints.
- **Validation**: Robust input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Supports pagination, filtering, and sorting for scalable data management.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful HTTP response codes.

## API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/resources` – Retrieve a list of resources.
- **GET** `/api/resources/{id}` – Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **POST** `/api/resources` – Create a new resource.
- **PUT** `/api/resources/{id}` – Update an existing resource by ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/resources/{id}` – Delete a resource by ID.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for JavaScript/TypeScript-based APIs)
- **Python** (for Flask/Django-based APIs)
- **Database** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/rest-api.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up the environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Update with your database credentials and other configuration
    ```

4. Run the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Access the API at:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

## Example Requests
1. **Create a resource**:
    ```bash
    POST /api/resources
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "name": "Sample Resource",
        "description": "A description of the resource"
    }
    ```

2. **Get a list of resources**:
    ```bash
    GET /api/resources
    ```

3. **Update a resource**:
    ```bash
    PUT /api/resources/{id}
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "name": "Updated Resource Name"
    }
    ```

## Testing
Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
- **Caching**: Adding caching mechanisms for optimized performance.
- **Webhooks**: Enabling webhook support for real-time data updates.
